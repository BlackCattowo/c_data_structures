## Arrays and Dynamic Arrays:
Arrays and dynamic arrays are the most basic form of data struture, they act as list to store a given number of basic informations together.
You can see how they work and what are their differences right bellow.
<br>

### Arrays:
&emsp; An array is a collection of elements (values or variables), of same memory size, each identified by it's index. <br>
&emsp; A simple array cannot change its size by itself and will require complex functions to alter their elements and adjust their sizes.

### Dynamic Arrays:
&emsp; A dynamic array is a type made using **struct** that creates an array with innate capacity of changing it's size, as well as adding<br>
&emsp; and removing an element from any position within its index. A programmer may add additional features to a dynamic array, <br>
&emsp; like an innate search function.
